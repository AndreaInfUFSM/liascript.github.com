With Lia, we try to implement an extended Markdown format that should enable
everyone to create, share, adapt, translate or correct and extend online courses
without the need of being a web-developer.

See the online rendered version at:
https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md

                                    --{{0}}--
Click on the (ear) button at the navigation bar to switch between spoken and
plain text mode format. And use the arrows-buttons at the top for navigating.


*Lia-Script* <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "color: red;" onclick = "alert('It started with a click!');" -->
is an extended Markdown format for writing interactive online
courses. Imagine all schoolbooks, technical or scientific literature could
become open-source projects and more interactive ... with collaborating teachers
and students ...

* easy to share adapt and translate
* no additional software required, everything is implemented in JavaScript/Elm
  and runs directly within the browser (online)
* automatic conversion to epub, pdf, ...


                                     --{{1}}--
Everything that is required is simple text-editor and a web-browser. Or you
start directly to create and share your course on github. The entire parsing and
transformation of Lia-Markdown to any other format is done within the browser at
client-side.


## Tools

                                     --{{0}}--
There are currently 2 Plugins for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) available,
which are intended to ease and simplify the development of online course with
LiaScript.

[liascript-preview](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview): Is a tiny
previewer that, if it was toggled, updates the view on your course each time you
save your document.


![previewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview/master/preview.gif)<!-- style="width: 100%" -->

[liascript-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets): If you start
typing "lia" in your document you switch on a fuzzy search, that contains a lot
of LiaScript help, examples, and snippets.

## *Markdown*-Syntax


                                     --{{0}}--
This section is intended to give a brief overview on the basic Markdown
formatting elements. The only difference to common Markdown at this point is,
that every course has to start with a comment, which defines authors, a language
and  a narrator voice, see https://responsivevoice.org for all supported voices.

Initial LIA-comment-tag for basic definitions:

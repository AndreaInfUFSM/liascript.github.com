This example is a port of the Lua programming course from the open wikibook [Lua-Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lua_Programming) to LiaScript. It is a fully working Lua programming course, that can be used as a basis for your own course.

This example uses the [Lua template](https://github.com/liaTemplates/Lua) which implements the Lua interpreter and VM from interpreter and VM [https://daurnimator.github.io](https://daurnimator.github.io). The only that is required to make Lua code snippets executable in LiaScript is to attach the `@LUA.eval` macro to every code block.

description: "Interactive conference paper for the eLearning 2019 conference in Porto"
---

This is the first paper published about LiaScript, which was presented at the _International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) International Conference on e-Learning 2019_ in Porto. It gives an overview of the language and its features, as well as the motivation behind its development.

__Abstract.__ LiaScript is an attempt to enable everyone to create free and interactive online courses, without the need of being an experienced programmer. Instead, it aims to bring both parties, software-and course-developers, closer together by introducing Open-Source techniques into the Open-courSe development process. LiaScript was designed to be compatible to Common-Markdown, but it introduces lots of language extensions that deal with quizzes, surveys, ASCII-art, text2speech, animations, online programming, the integration of JavaScript, etc. as well as its own macro-system that simplifies tedious and repetitive tasks. It comes along with its own just-in-time compiler that runs in the browser and therefor does not require additional tooling.

> The video recording below was made at the 7th of April in 2024. I am looking back at the conference with a smile, remembering that the best presentation award was a publication that made calculations and estimates about the real prices of developing online courses and MOOCs with traditional tools and systems... The same document that I wrote 5 years ago, is still there, it can be still used. The document did not change, while we constantly improve the interpreter.

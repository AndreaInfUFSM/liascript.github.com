The University Future Festival 2023 was an event hosted by the Hochschulforum Digitalisierung and the Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre. The event was held both in-person and online from April 26 to April 28, 2023. The festival was designed to be "Digital first", meaning all aspects of the festival could be experienced online, with physical stages in various locations in Germany offering additional networking opportunities [festival.hfd.digital](https://festival.hfd.digital/de/).

The festival addressed a broad spectrum of topics related to the opportunities and challenges of digital transformation. These included AI, architecture, technology, strategy development, competencies, didactics, and more. It featured over 300 lectures, workshops, discussions, and micro-trainings, selected from 620 submissions from an international university community.

Also we took part and held a talk on the core concepts and ideas on LiaScript:

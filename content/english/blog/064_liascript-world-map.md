This idea was motivated by the [OER-World Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLcd41vLDGs) in order to to visualize the distribution of educational content that was created with LiaScript or events and meetings. Our map is based on the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/51.330/10.453) and uses the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to display the markers.
Blue is associated to projects, while future events are displayed in green and past events in transparent gray.

All information about the projects is stored within a static YAML-file:

https://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com/world-map/projects.yml

If you want to add your project to this map, the easiest way is to send us an email with the following information, or leave a comment:

``` yaml
- title: "Your Project Title"
  link: "https://link-to-your-project.web"
  gps:
    latitude: 51.330
    longitude: 10.453
  image: "https://link-to-your-image.jpg"
  icon: "https://link-to-your-organization-icon.png"
  description: |
    This can be a description of your project where you can also embed HTML,
    with more links or contact information

We will add your information to `projects.yml` and update the map.

> The only information that is mandatory is the `title`, `link`, and `gps`. The `image` is optional, but it will make your project more visible. The `description` can be a short text or a long description, and you can also embed HTML, like links or images. The `categories` and `tags` are optional too, but they will help to filter the projects later on the map. And finally, the `icon` is optional, and we will later use this to modify the markers on the map, which can be a logo of your institution, project, or company. `date` is optional and will be used to classify markers to projects or events.

Otherwise you can also fork the repository `https://github.com/liascript/liascript.github.com`, add your project by yourself and create a pull request. This way you will also be visible in the list of contributors on GitHub ðŸ˜‰

If you host your project on GitHub you can also take a look at the following post to increase its visibility:

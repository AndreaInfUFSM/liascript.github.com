This blog entry presents an example of how to import A-Frame 3D models, scenes, and more into LiaScript open-courSes.

The entire README file can be interpreted as a library, we say template, that only needs to be imported into your LiaScript course via:

``` markdown
<!--
import: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/aframe/master/README.md
-->

# Your Course
```

And then you can start to use all the features and examples that are provided in the original README file.

The idea of a template is to provide a fully functional course that also works as documentation for the implemented functionality/macros. During the initialization LiaScript will only parse the main-header of the import and load all JavaScript, CSS, defined macros and make them usable in your course.

The following link will open the course in the LiaScript editor:

{{< button link="https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/aframe/master/README.md" label="Open AFrame in LiaScript" >}}

... or take a look at the implementation within the LiaScript LiveEditor:

{{< button link="https://liascript.github.io/LiveEditor/?/show/file/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/aframe/master/README.md" label="Open AFrame in LiveEditor" >}}

or visit the implementation on GitHub:

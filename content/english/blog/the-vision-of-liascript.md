This poster represents one of the earliest publications on LiaScript, showcasing our pioneering ideas on leveraging open-source methodologies to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Over the years, LiaScript has undergone significant evolution, yet the foundational principles, key concepts, and the syntax have steadfastly remained unchanged. We made a minor but crucial modification in our approach to embedding videos; we shifted from using the `!!` link syntax to `!?`. This change was implemented to avoid confusion with other markdown interpreters and platforms like GitHub, ensuring our examples remain accessible and functional. These examples continue to serve as valuable resources for those looking to craft their own courses.

It's crucial to underline that the essence of our content lies within a single, interpretable text file, processed by a browser-based application. This unique approach allows for continuous improvement of the application's user experience while simultaneously empowering educators to refine and update course content. Our decision to focus on a browser-app over developing a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle has proven to be a strategic choice. It has enabled us to avoid the pitfalls of quickly outdated course materials, offering a dynamic and flexible learning environment that stands the test of time.

Our journey from the inception of LiaScript to its current state highlights our commitment to open education and the potential of open-source tools in transforming the landscape of online learning. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to enhancing LiaScript as an alternative to centralized platforms and expanding the possibilities for educators worldwide to create engaging, accessible, and high-quality online courses.

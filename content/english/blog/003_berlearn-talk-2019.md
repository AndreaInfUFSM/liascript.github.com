This is an early example of a LiaScript presentation, that was given as a BearLearn Talk 2019 in Berlin.
It shows how to create a simple narrative presentations with Text-to-Speech output and animations and more.
The arguments for creating a markup language for open online-courses are still the same. And if you inspect the course, you will see, that the format of the course has not changed at all, only the URL, the syntax is still the same, we only added more features to the interpreter and improved the presentation.
